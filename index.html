        <h2>Dream Big</h2>
        <h3>I will become a developer</h3>
        <p>On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young
            man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S.
            Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards
            K. bridge.
            He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the
            
            staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto-
            ried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The
            
            landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at-
            tendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went
            
            out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which
            invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young
            man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl
            and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady,
            and was afraid of meeting her.</p>
